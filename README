TS Toolkit is an application to modify an mpeg2 transport stream file on the file.

Currently the following functionalities are implemented:

1. Convert X31 signalling to SCTE35
2. Introduce AIT to the transport stream

--work in progress --
3. Add DSMCC carousels to the stream

The application is reading all the settings from a config file, please check the enclosed samples.

Transport streams are captured through a GStreamer pipeline and after modifications streamed out through a second pipeline.
Pipelines are defined accoroding to the gst-launch syntax.
